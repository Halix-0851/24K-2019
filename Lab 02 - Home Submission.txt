Objective 03:-
TASK 01:-
Ask the user to enter Nth number (divisor)
Ask the user to enter n the number to check if it can be divided by Nth 
Divide the number n by Nth 
Set the Ans to the calculated Answer
Check If Ans is a real number 
If it is a real number then 
Check if the number,n  is Even (by dividing it by 2;If real number then the num is even)
If the result is a real number again then set Even to True
Display The “Nth” number is divisible by “n”
Display “The Number is even” If Even is set to True
 Else Display “The Number is Odd”


TASK 03:-
Ask the user to enter Num1
Ask the user to enter Num2
Ask the user to	enter Operator (+,-,*,/,%)
If the Operator is “+”
Then Ans will be set to Num1+Num2
If the Operator is “-”
The Ans will be set to Num1-Num2
If the Operator is “*”
The Ans will be set to Num1*Num2
If the Operator is “/” then
Ans will be set to Num1/Num2
If the Operator is “%” then 
If the Operator is “%”then
Ans will be set to the remainder of or MOD of Num1/Num2
Display “Your Answer is”,Ans
